Each bar represents a specific room type, and the height of the bar reflects the average price, making it easy to compare the pricing visually.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Clarity and Readability**: The bar graph is straightforward and easy to read, making it suitable for presenting insights to a wide range of audiences, including non-technical stakeholders. The clear visualization allows viewers to understand the price differences between room types across different neighborhood groups.\n",
        "\n",

For instance, we might notice that the \"reviews_per_month\" and \"number_of_reviews\" variables have a positive correlation, suggesting that listings with more reviews per month also tend to have more total reviews. Similarly, we might observe that the \"availability_365\" and \"calculated_host_listings_count\" variables have a negative correlation, indicating that listings with higher host listing counts tend to have lower availability throughout the year.
